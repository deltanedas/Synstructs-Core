# Description
A framework using Artificial Beings Framework (ABF) to implement all the core features necessary to have Synstruct races: An advanced set of synthetic beings that have created a culture all of their own and that have long since integrated into humanity's norms. This framework contains all of the core content and abstract information necessary to for sub mods to implement individual races and mechanics. This mod does not contain any races itself.


## Features
This mod contains content that is shared between the various types of synstructs, including:
* Basic backstories for all kinds of player synstructs
* Body part definitions used by submods to lay out their races' body types.
* Directives that reprogrammable synstructs can have implemented to enhance their capabilities.
* Drugs that directly benefit synstructs in particular while mostly being toxic for other races to consume.
* Implants ranging from part upgrades to implants to whole new chassis and frame replacements.
* Hediffs unique to synstructs that replace vanilla hediffs like hypothermia or heatstroke.
* An event that can fire for synstructs where they will ask for permission to change their personality slightly from time to time.
* Abstract information defined for all synstruct humanlike and animal pawns to use.
* Unique thoughts for synstructs.
* A mechanic called Coherence that requires synstructs to meditate on a semi-regular basis to maintain a stable, healthy, happy existence.
* Various items to repair, improve, or otherwise be used by synstructs.


Synstructs have a number of unique features that should be kept in mind, including:
* The ability to both charge and consume food to fill their need for energy.
    * Synstructs will always attempt to charge if they can, and consume food only if they cannot.
    * Some synstructs charge faster or slower than others. Some receive more or less energy from food - and some cannot eat food at all.
    * Synstructs can charge in any bed that has an attached Bedside Charger facility, or can charge around a specialized charging station (although it's uncomfortable and not private).
* A need for coolant and lubricant in order to keep fully operational.
    * Both coolant and lubricant come in packs, manufacturable from the drug lab or en masse at the biofuel refinery. It requires neutroamine and chemfuel to produce.
    * Coolant is strictly necessary to keep operating. While most synstructs only need to be topped up every year or so, they will rapidly enter a comatose state if not supplied.
    * Lubricant is a helpful but non-essential chemical for them. It must be refilled roughly every quadrum, and synstructs who run out will suffer mild penalties.
    * Each race has different needs. Some synstructs may not need one or both. Some synstructs require a vast amount to keep running.
* A need to run self-maintenance cycles in order to keep a coherent existence.
    * Synstructs will build coherence whenever they are idle or when the need is lower than the target threshold and they are not preoccupied with high priority work tasks. They will not build coherence in the work time assignment unless they are idle. They will prioritize building coherence if in the meditate (Royalty DLC) or sleep time assignments.
    * Synstructs will prefer to build coherence at a designated spot or in their room, if they have either.
    * Synstructs will have a higher mood when at high average coherence, and a poorer mood at low average coherence. This is affected by certain traits.
    * Random positive or negative effects can occur depending on the synstruct's coherence, ranging from critical errors to powerful optimizations.
    * Many synstructs will be better off maintaining a middle-of-the-road approach to their coherence than trying to always maximize it.
* An aversion to Archotechnology due to being spurned by the great powers that they are not subject to.
    * Synstructs have no psychic sensitivity and no organic matter with which to interface with Psylinks, Mechlinks, or other psychic implements.
    * Designed and crafted by human researchers with no working understanding of how psychic powers work, synstructs are immune to most such phenomena.
    * Archotech implants and upgrades will resist being used by synstructs, and will deeply unsettle them.
* The restriction that only repair stims can be used to repair synstructs, as normal medicine does not work. Some synstructs may even require higher grade repair stims.
* The ability to be revived by restruct kits that are manufacturable, rather than mech serum. Make sure to use the correct kit on the correct kind of synstruct.
* The ability to be configured as drones, reprogrammable drones, or sapient individuals. Simple surgical operations can change their state - but know that stripping a synstruct of its sapience is murder!

Some content may not be accessible without races to use them! It is designed to be extended by my sub mods or other authors to have an easy way of implementing synstruct (or synstruct-like) races. All content and mechanics are accessible/extensible in xml, meaning individual races can pick and choose what mechanics they utilize.


## Known Issues / Incompatibilities
